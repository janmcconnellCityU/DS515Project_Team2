## **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to analyze current state and future trends in customer sales for the most popular grouping based on current sales/transactions using R programming. We will utilize segmentation techniques such as **K-means** and **agglomerative clustering** to provide user segment profiles that can be utilized by collaborative filtering to improve recommendations. We will also identify opportunities using descriptive and predictive analytics techniques and methods, including **regression** and **time-series** analysis, and visualizations using **ggplot2**. 

## **Acknowledgments**

We would like to thank our instructor, **Dr. Paul Dooley**, and **City University of Seattle** for providing the resources and guidance needed to complete this project.

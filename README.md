<h2 style="color:blue;">Project Description</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to develop a hybrid recommendation system that utilizes collaborative filtering and segmentation techniques using R programming to target improvements in the recommendation system for new users. We will utilize segmentation techniques such as <b>K-means</b> and <b>agglomerative clustering</b> to provide user segment profiles that can be utilized by collaborative filtering to improve recommendations. We will evaluate the recommendation system using metrics such as <b>Precision</b>, <b>Recall</b>, <b>F1-Score</b>, <b>RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)</b>, and <b>MAE (Mean Absolute Error)</b>. We will also compare the performance of the hybrid system and those of the individual collaborative and clustering methods, utilizing data visualization techniques to illustrate results. We will also consider the impact of scalability and processing time on the recommendation systemsâ€™ usability and success.</p>
